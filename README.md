## Hi! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Elizabeth, and I'm a student Software Developer. I'm 18 years old and I mainly love working on web-development and game-development! I'm proficient in HTML and CSS and prefer using VS Code as IDE. I've worked with other languages such as C#, XAML, PHP and MySQL before, but am far from proficient and still learning how to use them! Same goes for using VS as IDE and Unity as program for game development.
## My Hobbies and Passions
Outside of development, I love listening to music, doing fitness in my home gym, hanging out in VRChat, watching YouTube and learning new spoken languages. I'm currently learning Spanish, and want to learn many more.
## My Projects
I am still working on my projects and contributions, so keep an eye out!
## Future Goals
Despite my proficiency mainly being in web development, I really want to become a game developer and modder.
